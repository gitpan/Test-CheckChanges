NAME
    Test::CheckChanges - Check that the Changes file matches the
    distribution.

VERSION
    Version 0.03

SYNOPSIS
     use Test::CheckChanges;
     ok_changes();

DESCRIPTION
    Currently only checks that the version in the changes file matches the
    version of the distrobution.

    The version is taken out of the Build data or the Makefile.

FUNCTIONS
    All functions listed below are exported to the calling namespace.

  ok_changes( )
        The ok_changes method takes no arguments and returns no value.

CHANGES FILE FORMAT
    Currently this package parses 2 different types of "Changes" files. The
    first is the common, free style, "Changes" file where the version is
    first item on an unindetned line:

     0.01  Fri May  2 15:56:25 EDT 2008
           - more info  

    The second type of file parsed is the Module::Changes::YAML format
    changes file.

    Create an RT if you need a different format file supported. If it is not
    horrid, I will add it.

    The Debian style "Changes" file will like be the first new format added.

BUGS
    Please open an RT if you find a bug.

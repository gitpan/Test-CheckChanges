NAME
    Test::CheckChanges - Check that the Changes file matches the
    distribution.

VERSION
    Version 0.11

SYNOPSIS
     use Test::CheckChanges;
     ok_changes();

    You can make the test optional with

     use Test::More;
     eval 'use Test::CheckChanges;';
     if ($@) {
         plan skip_all => 'Test::CheckChanges required for testing the Changes file';
     }
     ok_changes();

DESCRIPTION
    This module checks that you *Changes* file has an entry for the current
    version of the Module being tested.

    The version information for the distribution being tested is taken out
    of the Build data, or if that is not found, out of the Makefile.

    It then attempts to open, in order, a file with the name *Changes* or
    *CHANGES*.

    The *Changes* file is then parsed for version numbers. If one and only
    one of the version numbers matches the test passes. Otherwise the test
    fails.

    A message with the current version is printed if the test passes,
    otherwise dialog messages are printed to help explain the failure.

    The *examples* directory contains examples of the different formats of
    *Changes* files that are recognized.

FUNCTIONS
    All functions listed below are exported to the calling namespace.

  ok_changes( )
        The ok_changes method takes no arguments and returns no value.

CHANGES FILE FORMAT
    Currently this package parses 4 different types of "Changes" files. The
    first is the common, free style, "Changes" file where the version is
    first item on an unindented line:

     0.01  Fri May  2 15:56:25 EDT 2008
           - more info

    The second type of file parsed is the Module::Changes::YAML format
    changes file.

    The third type of file parsed has the version number proceeded by an *
    (asterisk).

     Revision history for Perl extension Foo::Bar

     * 1.00

     Is this a bug or a feature

    The fourth type of file parsed starts the line with the word Version
    followed by the version number.

     Version 6.00  17.02.2008
      + Oops. Fixed version number. '5.10' is less than '5.9'. I thought
        CPAN would handle this but apparently not..

    There are examples of these Changes file in the *examples* directory.

    Create an RT if you need a different format file supported. If it is not
    horrid, I will add it.

    The Debian style "Changes" file will likely be the first new format
    added.

BUGS
    Please open an RT if you find a bug.
